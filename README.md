# Refactoring Horiseon Webpage

## Description:

This project changes the existing html/css for the Horiseon webpage without changing the page itself. Just refactoring the code to be more semantic and easier to read, as well as removing repititive code. 
  - Motivation for this project was purely to learn more about semantic elements and html/css in general.
  - I built this project to learn and familarize myself with a real-world project such as this (refactoring existing code).
  - The webpage now looks a lot cleaner and is easier to read, it is also now shorter after removing redundant/repetitive code.
  - From doing this project I learned how to take bite-size chunks and fix one thing at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed by all the starter code.
